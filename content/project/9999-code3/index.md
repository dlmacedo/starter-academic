A project to improve out-of-distribution detection (open set recognition) and uncertainty estimation by changing a few lines of code in your project! Perform efficient inferences (i.e., do not increase inference time) without repetitive model training, hyperparameter tuning, or collecting additional data. We keep single network inference efficiency. No hyperparameter tuning. We need to train only once. SOTA.
