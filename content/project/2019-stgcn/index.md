The recognition of sign language is a challenging task with an important role in society to facilitate the communication of deaf persons. We propose a new approach of Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for sign language recognition based on the human skeletal movements. The method uses graphs to capture the dynamics of the signs in two dimensions, spatial and temporal, considering the complex aspects of the language. Additionally, we present a new dataset of human skeletons for sign language based on ASLLVD to contribute to future related studies.
