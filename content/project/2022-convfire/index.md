Early alert fire and smoke detection systems are crucial for daily and security management decision-making. Recent literature approaches are based on Deep Learning (DL) models. Efficient models are required for hardware-constrained systems, such as mobile devices, embedded systems, and robotics achieving high performance at low power consumption. For this research, we designed a novel specific-purpose model for fire and smoke recognition using still images and the study of state-of-the-art convolution techniques to improve the trade-off between accuracy and complexity. In this regard, the literature suggests that the inverted residual block, the depthwise and octave convolution techniques, reduces the modelâ€™s size and computation requirements working well by themselves. In this work, we propose the KutralNext architecture, an efficient model for single- and multi-label fire and smoke recognition tasks. Additionally, a more efficient architecture KutralNext+, demonstrates that those convolution techniques achieve a better trade-off combined, reaching an 84.36% average test accuracy in FireNet, FiSmo, and FiSmoA fire datasets. The KutralSmoke and FiSmo fire and smoke datasets attained an 81.53% average test accuracy. Furthermore, a previous fire and smoke recognition model considered, FireDetection, KutralNext uses 59% fewer parameters, and KutralNext+ requires 97% fewer flops and is 4x faster.
